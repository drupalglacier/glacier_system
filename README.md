# System
The glacier System module is the basis for a wide variety of features which
make site building with Drupal faster an easier.

## Extend
You can find compatible features on [Github](https://github.com/drupalglacier).  
Features that extend the glacier system must be placed in the `features`
directory inside the glacier_system module.

## Deployment
This module serves as the basis for the implementation of a stable deployment
workflow. In the `glacier_system.install` file you can find a basic update hook
that can serve as a basis for installing and configuring a Drupal system. You
can use the `glacier_system.install` file as a starting point for your
deployment workflow.
