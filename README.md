# System
The glacier System module is the basis for a wide variety of features which
make site building with Drupal faster an easier.

## Installation
You must install the module inside a subdirectory of your modules folder
(e.g. `sites/all/modules/features`).

## Extend
You can find compatible features on [Github](https://github.com/drupalglacier).  
Features that extend the glacier System must be placed in the same directory as
the glacier System module itself (usually `sites/all/modules/features`).
