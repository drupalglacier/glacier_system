# System
The glacier_system feature is the basis for a wide variety of features which
make site building with Drupal faster an easier.

## Extend
You can find compatible features on [Github](https://github.com/drupalglacier).  
Features that extend the glacier system must be placed in the „features“
directory inside the glacier_system module.
